# Anonymous Chat | Next.js
ðŸ¥· This project allows you to chat anonymously as soon as you enter the site.

ðŸš€ When you enter the site, an ID (number) is assigned to each user (per IP address) and you can start chatting directly.

ðŸ¤¯ Moreover, in the messages area, you can start a private chat by clicking on the ID (number) of the users who wrote the message 

ðŸ“œ This project is inspired by the [5e5](https://5e5.org) website, which is a product of the [Prooyun](https://prooyun.net) company.
